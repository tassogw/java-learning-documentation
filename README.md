## The documentation objective
The main reason for the creation of this repo is for documentating my (ongoing) knowledge in Java programming. I wanted to write down what i've been and will be learning about this programming language in specific, but i came to realize that taking notes, _in a literal sense_, wouldn't be as effective as I wanted it to be, considering I'd like to make future changes and make the whole file more readable. Writing down all of this potential knowledge in physical or raw digital notes would be an exhausting task, so I found that doing it this way would be a great solution and it will certainly bring lots of positive aspects. The documentation is question refers to [this file](javadocm.md) that contains all the main content.  

## Learning to use Github and Markdown
One of these positive aspects mentioned is learning how to use **Github**, **Github Desktop** and to write down **Markdown files**. As I specified before, I was looking for a way to use formatted text to improve the quality of reading, considering raw notes would be hard to create and understand, that was when I discovered Markdown. It immediatly got my attention and I got right into learning the basics so I could implement it into my documentation, thus, being able to practice a new skill and use it on a platform that I'm surely going to use a lot later on as a programmer.

## English writing skills improvement
Besides that, writing long texts is going to help me **improve my english writing skills**, considering _brazilian portuguese_ is my native language. I'm a science computation student at the UFPB (Universidade Federal da ParaÃ­ba) and I'm currently learning Java in _Programming Language 1_ subject. Recently I was doing my homework coding and asked my friend for help and noticed he was coding in english. He explained to me that it was a good habit, since it would be essencial if uploading something online (specially on Github) to code in english. I agreed and thought it would be perfect to do it while making this repository, so I could not only help myself by improving an existing skill but also make it more accessible worldwide. 

## Github showcase
Finally, the last reason would be to have a **showcase** on my Github profile. At the moment I'm typing this, I don't have any other project/repo on my Github, so creating this educational repository would be a huge step forward. I'm intending to change it in the future, but as now, doing this will help myself with all the topics mentioned above _and_ other people interested in my work for any reason.
