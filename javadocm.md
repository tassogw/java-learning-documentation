## Java presentation
First of all, we'll get started with the basics: what do you need to know about Java before start learning? What's it's **programming paradigm**? Why is it a great programming language to learn? etc.  

### Early concepts
Java is a **object-oriented programming (OOP)** language, which means it works mainly with _classes_ and _objects_, being that the major difference in relation to structured programming. It also means that Java can work with coding structures better approached to real life object managing. Java is also known for being flexible in terms of **compatibility**, this means that it can be apllied in various device types with many different purposes (for example: web or distributed programming for PC's and mobile devices).  

### Why learn Java?
Marketwise, Java is one of the most demanded programming languages nowadays and it's for a good amount of reasons. As mentioned before, Java is compatible with various devices and can be useful for many ideas, giving the developers lots of opportunities to work with, specially with big multiplatform applications that requires great amounts of features and conectivity. Besides that, it's relativily beginner friendly (for being high level) in comparison to other languages like _C_ and _C++_ and it has a huge community of devs that can help anyone anywhere you can find online. These are just some of many reasons to learn Java, it surely is a big deal in software creation.
