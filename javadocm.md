## Java presentation
First of all, we'll get started with the basics: what do you need to know about Java before start learning? What's it's **programming paradigm**? Why is it a great programming language to learn? etc.  

### Early concepts
Java is a **object-oriented programming (OOP)** language, which means it works mainly with _classes_ and _objects_, being that the major difference in relation to structured programming. It also means that Java can work with coding structures better approached to real life object managing. Java is also known for being flexible in terms of **compatibility**, this means that it can be apllied in various device types with many different purposes (for example: web or distributed programming for PC's and mobile devices).  

### Why learn Java?
Marketwise, Java is one of the most demanded programming languages nowadays and it's for a good amount of reasons. As mentioned before, Java is compatible with various devices and can be useful for many ideas, giving the developers lots of opportunities to work with, specially with big multiplatform applications that requires great amounts of features and conectivity. Besides that, it's relativily beginner friendly (for being high level) in comparison to other languages like _C_ and _C++_ and it has a huge community of devs that can help anyone anywhere you can find online. These are just some of many reasons to learn Java, it surely is a big deal in software creation.

> Java appears in 2nd place among the most demanded languages of 2022 based on _LinkedIn_ job posts in USA and Europe.

### File managing
With a proper IDE, managing files in Java can be a great way to organize programs and make everything properly connected. A Java application consists in a group of **classes** (functions, in a certain way), with each class having their own implementation inside the system in question and being connected one with another, making the whole code work. You're also able to group up those linked classes _logically_ inside a **package**, making the proccess more practical considering it's easir to visualize. Once you have a code, it can run pretty much everywhere with **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**, that generates a _Bytecode_ from the `.java` compiled file and executes it in any operational system. JVM has a version for each OS, making the compatibility as it is.

## Variables in Java

### Primitive types and their usage
About **declaring variables**, it's pretty simple to get started, you just need to use the following model to create a variable: \<type> \<name> = \<value>  
Example:  
``` java
int count = 10;
```  

It's also very easy getting used to the referred syntax and their specific sizes and usage, just by following this table:

Having these informations in hand, we'll head into each type and their characteristics, knowing how to insert them properly inside your code.  

- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- char
- boolean
